the same time what concerns me now is quantity When I got a letter from Jack Arends asking me to lecture at the Teachers College I wrote back and said Id be glad to that all he had to do was let me know the date He did I then said to David Tudor The lecture is so soon that I dont think Ill be able to get all ninety stories written in which case now and then Ill just keep my trap shut He said Thatll be a relief A very dirty composer was attempting to explain to a friend how dirty a person was whom he had recently met He said He has dirt between his fingers the way you and I have between

the impression of not being overly fond of mushrooms But one night he had two helpings of morels and then finished the dish completely including the juice The next afternoon while he was shaving I read out loud the following quotation from Leonardo da Vinci Lo Some there are who can call themselves nothing more than a passage for food producers of dung fillers up of privies for of them nothing else appears in the world nor is there any virtue in their work for nothing of them remains but full privies David Tudor said Perhaps they were good Buddhists My grandmother was sometimes very deaf and at other times particularly when someone was talking about her not deaf at all One Sunday she was sitting in the living room directly in front of the radio She had a sermon turned on so loud that it could be heard for blocks around And yet she was sound asleep and snoring I tiptoed into the living room hoping to get a manuscript that was on the piano and to get out again without waking her up I almost did it But just as I got to the door the radio went off and Grandmother spoke sharply John are you ready for the second coming of the Lord The day after I finally won the Italian TV quiz on mushrooms I received anonymously in the mail Volume 2 of a French book on mushrooms that had been published in Germany I was studying it in a crowded streetcar going to downtown Milan The lady next to me said What are you reading that for Thats finished Elizabeth it is a beautiful day Let us take a walk Perhaps we will find some mushrooms If we do we shall pluck them and eat them Betsy Zogbaum asked Marian Powys Grey whether she knew the difference between mushrooms and toadstools I think I do But consider my dear how dull life would be without a little uncertainty in it Just before setting out for Saskatchewan to conduct a music workshop at Emma Lake in July 1965 I received a request from the editor of Canadian Art for an article having fifteen hundred words Since I was busy with a number of projects I was on the point of replying that I had no time when I noticed that I would be at the workshop for fifteen days and that if I wrote one hundred words a day it wouldnt be too much for me and the magazine would get what it wanted I then replied with a certain firmness telling the editor that I would only do this if he would accept my work in advance not change it in any way typographically and let me see and correct proof I was still cross with the editors of the Kenyon Review because of the way they had treated my text on Schoenbergs Letters Everything was agreed to and when the proof came there was nothing in it to correct However when it was printed in the January 1966 issue a headnote accompanied it which suggested the frame of mind a reader might have were he to enjoy my text Explanatory notes followed All of that material is here omitted Instead of different type faces I used parentheses and italics to distinguish one statement from another I set the text in a single block like a paragraph of prose Otherwise I used the mosaicdiscipline of writing described in the note preceding The role of the composer is other than it was Teaching too is no longer

to find wild plants doing equally well One winter David Tudor and I were touring in the Middle West From Cincinnati we drove to Yellow Springs to drum up an engagement for Merce Cunningham and his Dance Company In this way we met the McGarys Keith was teaching philosophy at Antioch College and Donna taught weaving and dancing My conversation with Keith McGary had no sooner begun than we discovered our mutual interest in mushrooms I told him that Id never seen the wintergrowing Collybia velutipes He opened the front door and using a flashlight showed me the plant growing in the snow from the roots of a nearby tree He told me what difficulty he was having finding books about fungi I gave him my copy of Hard which Id brought along This books deals especially with Ohio mushrooms The next day I located two copies of the book in a secondhand bookstore in Columbus I bought them both Each winter I find the Collybia the velvet footed in quantity How is it I didnt notice it during the winters before I met Keith McGary Wed gotten together and so could separate Lois Long Esther Dam Ralph Ferrara and I were in the Haverstraw cemetery gathering Tricholoina personatum An elderly lady with a hat on standing by while a man she was with was tending a grave happened to notice us She called out asking what we were doing there We said we were looking for mushrooms Her voice rose slightly as she asked whether Lois Longs Volkswagen which was parked nearby belonged to one of us The next thing she asked her voice sharpedged was whether we had loved ones buried there Hearing no one of us did she spoke firmly and loudly Well I dont like it and I dont think any one else would like it If the mushrooms grow here let them Meanwhile the gentleman with her paid no attention He just went on doing what he was doing And we walking dutifully toward the little car passed by quantities of our favorite mushrooms making not the slightest attempt to pick them As we drove off the woman

adjacent the one we know in It wont sound like musicserial or electronic Itll sound like what we hear when were not hearing music just hearing whatever wherever we happen to be But to accomplish this our technological means must be constantly changing They said one thing involving symbols linear relationships which made me think they didnt understand But then they said something else that the schools days of being open would be unpredictably arranged The result was we had a pleasant day together At present it appears to be a series of components a sound system but it is a series of components not a series of components Soon twill be done wirelessly then it wont appear to be different than what it already essentially is not a series of components Max Ernst around 1950 speaking at the Arts Club on Eighth Street in New York City said that significant changes in the arts formerly occurred every three hundred years whereas now they take place every twenty minutes Such changes happen first in the arts which like plants are fixed to particular points in space architecture painting and sculpture They happen afterward in the performance arts music and theatre which require as animals do the passing of time for their realization In literature as with the myxomycetes and similar organisms which are classified sometimes as plants and sometimes as animals changes take place both early and late Last April in Hawaii I asked Tohru Takemitsu what Maki his threeyearold daughter thought of the United States He said She thinks its another part of Japan Visiting Hamada in Machiko I expected there off the beaten track to see things specifically Japanese Hamada showed pots objects and furniture from all over the world Spain Mexico China Arizona The situation music finds itself in in the United States and Europe it also finds itself in in Japan We live in a global village Buckminster Fuller H Marshall McLuhan Maki is right If this elevatororiginated music had been heard what modern Japanese music would it have been Who among the following would have made this possibility an actuality a music which we will soon hear whether we happen to be in Tokyo New York Berlin or Bombay Yoriaki Matsudaira Yuji Takahashi Joji Yuasa Tohru Takemitsu Takehisa Kosugi Toshi Ichiyanagi But like other unpleasant things and experiences they are good for us Why Because if we dont pamper ourselves but actually put up with the experience of them we find our ears and our lives changing not in a way that obliges us to go through Ichiyanagi or Japan for that matter to have our daily beauty but which fits us each moment no matter where we live to do our music ourselves I am speaking of nothing special just an open ear and an open mind and the enjoyment of daily noises Once when I was in Ann Arbor with Alexander Smith I said that one of the things I liked about botany was that it was free of the jealousies and selfish feelings that plague the arts that I would for that reason if for no other given my life to live over again be a botanist rather than a musician He said That shows how little you know about botany Later in the conversation I happened to mention the name of a mycologist connected with another Midwestern university Incisively Smith said Dont mention that mans name in my house There was an international conference of philosophers in Hawaii on the subject of Reality For three days Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki said nothing Finally the chairman turned to him and asked Dr Suzuki would you say this table around which we are sitting is real Suzuki raised his head and said Yes The chairman asked in what sense Suzuki thought the table was real Suzuki said In every sense The first time the mushroom class was given at the New School many people signed up for it The registrar was alarmed telephoned me and asked Where shall we draw the line I said if more than forty people were involved it might be difficult Something like that number registered for the course but when the field trips actually took place there were never more than twenty people in the woods Sometimes attendance dropped to a mere dozen I couldnt figure out what was happening I forget who it was but one day in the woods one of the lady students confessed that when she signed up for the course it was not with the intention of tramping through the woods near New York City fungi or no fungi She was interested in going to Europe Some airplane company had advertised inexpensive round trip fares purchasable only by adults enrolled in the New School People had studied the catalogue as though it were a menu looking for the cheapest course regardless of what was being taught The lady who told me this had had a change of mind or her particular flight had been postponed I dont remember which One way or another she lost interest in Europe Another noticing fungi in Bavarian and Milanese markets sent post cards When Colin McPhee found out that I was interested in mushrooms he said If you find the morel next spring call me up even if you only find one Ill drop everything come out and cook it Spring came I found two morels I called Colin McPhee He said You dont expect me do you to come all that way for two little mushrooms Mr Romanoff is sixty years old Mr Nearing is seventy years old Mr Romanoffs mother is eightyfive On one of the mushroom field trips a photographer came who had been sent by The New York Times We took the Stony Brook trail We had no sooner gotten started than the photographer busied himself taking pictures Soon Mr Romanoff was not to be seen Mr Nearing drew Lois Long aside and said Mr Romanoff has had an accident to his pants Would you find out whether one of the ladies has a safety pin Lois Long complied A very small safety pin was found and Lois Long gave it to Mr Romanoff He came back to the group The safety pin being so small proved ineffective Mr Romanoff nevertheless stayed with the group and as the walk continued the split in his pants progressed until it was complete crotch to cuff We stopped for lunch at a spring Mr Romanoff looked at his pants and said My mother will hear about this Mr Romanoff says the Sunday field trips are better than going to church However one Sunday he said I cant come next Sunday because its Rosh Hashana and Ive arranged with my mother that if I stay home on Rosh Hashana Ill be able to come on Yom Kippur Music and mushrooms two words next to one another in many dictionaries Where did he write The Threepenny Opera Now hes buried below the grass at the foot of High Tor Once the season changes from summer to fall given sufficient rain or just the mysterious dampness thats in the earth mushrooms grow there carrying on I am sure his business of working with sounds That we have no ears to hear the music the spores shot off from basidia make obliges us to busy ourselves microphonically While hunting morels with Alexander Smith in the woods near Ann Arbor I mentioned having found quantities of Lactarius deliciosus in the woods in northern Vermont He said Were the stipes viscid I said Yes they were He said Its not deliciosus its thyinos He went on to say that people go through their entire lives thinking that things are that when they are actually this and that these mistakes are necessarily made with the very things with which they are the most familiar David Tudor and I took a taxi down town He was going to Macys I was going on to West Broadway and Prince where I get my hair cut After David Tudor got out I began talking with the driver about the weather The relative merits of the Old Farmers Almanac and the newspapers came up The driver said they were developing rockets that would raise the weather mans predictions from 50 to 55 per cent accuracy I said I thought the Almanac starting from a consideration of planets and their movements Are we an audience for computer art The answers not No its Yes What we need is a computer that isnt laborsaving but which increases

ways to help you Id give you a lift for instance if you were going in my direction but the last thing Id do would be to tell you how to use your own aesthetic faculties You see Were unemployed If not yet soon again twill be We have nothing to do So what shall we do Sit in an audience Write criticism Be creative We used to have the artist up on a pedestal Now hes no more extraordinary than we are Notice audiences at high altitudes and audiences in northern countries tend to be attentive during performances while audiences at sea level or in warm countries voice their feelings whenever they have them Are we so to speak going south in the way we experience art Audience participation Having nothing to do we do it nonetheless our biggest problem is finding scraps of time in which to get it done Discovery Awareness Leave the beaten track Youll see something never seen before After the first performance of my piece for twelve radios Virgil Thomson said You cant do that sort of thing and expect people to pay for it Separation When our time was given to physical labor we needed a stiff upper lip and backbone Now that were changing our minds intent on things invisible inaudible we have other spineless virtues flexibility fluency Dreams daily events everything gets to and through us Art if you want a definition of it is criminal action It conforms to no rules Not even its own Anyone who experiences a work of art is as guilty as the artist It is not a question of sharing the guilt Each one of us gets all of it They asked me about theatres in New York I said we could use them They should be small for the audiences the performing areas large and spacious equipped for television broadcast for those who prefer staying at home There should be a cafe in connection having food and drink no music facilities for playing chess What happened at Rochester Wed no sooner begun playing than the audience began Began what Costumes Food Rolls of toilet paper projected in streamers from

audience can sit still or it can get up and move around People are people not plants Do you love the audience Certainly we do We show it by getting out of their way Art and money are in this world together and they need each other to keep on going Perhaps theyre both on their way out Moneyll become a credit card without a monthly bill Whatll art become A family reunion If so lets have it with people in the round each individual free to lend his attention wherever he will Meeting house After an Oriental decade a Tibetan Bikku returned to Toronto to teach He told me that were he to speak the truth his audience would drop to six Instead he gives lectures transmitting not the spirit but the understandable letter Two hundred people listen on each occasion all of them deeply moved Arts a way we have for throwing out ideasones weve picked up in or out of our heads Whats marvelous is that as we throw them outthese ideas they generate others ones that werent even in our heads to begin with Charles Ives had this idea the audience is any one of us just a human being He sits in a rocking chair on a verandah Looking out toward the mountains he sees the setting sun and hears his own symphony Seems Pollock tried to do it paint on glass It was in a movie There was an admission of failure That wasnt the way to proceed Its not a question of doing again what Duchamp already did We must nowadays nevertheless at least be able to look through to whats beyond as though we were in it looking out Whats more boring than Marcel Duchamp I ask you Ive books about his work but never bother to read them Busy as bees with noth ing to do He requires that we know that being an artist isnt childs play equivalent in difficulty surely to playing chess Furthermore a work of our art is not ours alone but belongs also to the opponent whos there to the end Anarchy At Darmstadt when I wasnt involved with music I was in the woods looking for mushrooms One day while I was gathering some Hypholomas that were growing around a stump not far from the concert hall a lady secretary came by and said After all Nature is better than Art After an hour or so in the woods looking for mushrooms Dad said Well we can always go and buy some real ones Sometime after my fathers death I was talking with Mother I suggested she take a trip West to visit the relatives I said Youll have a good time She was quick to reply Now John you know perfectly well that Ive never enjoyed having a good time When the New York Philharmonic played my Atlas Eclipticalis with Winter Music Electronic Version the audience more or less threw propriety to the winds Many walked out Others stayed to boo On Sunday afternoon the lady sitting next to my mother was particularly violent She disturbed everyone around her When the performance ended Mother turned to her and said I am the composers mother The lady said Good Heavens Your sons music is magnificent Would you tell him please how much I loved it Franz Kline was about to have the first showing of his black and white paintings at the Egan Gallery Realizing that his mother had never seen his paintings and that she would surely be interested in doing so he arranged for her to come to New York for the opening After she had been in the gallery for some time she said Franz I might have known youd find the easy way In 1960 I received a letter from a university president giving me an appointment for the following academic year I called Mother to tell her the good news I said Im to be a Fellow in the Center for Advanced Studies at Wesleyan University Mother said Why are they always connecting you with the dance Then after a pause she added Do they")
