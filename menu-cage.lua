Global params: 

Count = number of changes per voice = 8 to 64 
Rapidity = how frequently voices change = mean for a triangular random function to choose durations 0.1s to 40s 
Smoothness = how quickly changes happen = if playback speed is 1.0, then between 0.01s and 5 seconds, 
                                          triangular with mean at 0.5s. Scale with playback speed 
Density = ratio of silence to sound 

Rapidity x number of change = estimate time duration 

start = all voices have chosen track 1 = silence  

Each playhead: 
Buffer = a or b 
Track = 2-30 
Start Point = 0-10 
Loop end = start point to 10 
(all voices are looping)


Incrementing play time = taking playback rate into account. 
= update every 0.1s by adding rate/10 to an incrementer 
= when incrementer = target, change sound 

Softcut: 
softcut.loop_start(1,0) == start of loop 
softcut.loop_end(1,5)   == end of loop 
softcut.position(1,3)   == start position, must be inside the loop
